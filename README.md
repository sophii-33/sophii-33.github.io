### Welcome to My Sets of Work ðŸ˜† !
        *and I felt myself crumble - to you and your trap*  


Hii :D ! My name is Sophie Averilla and this website is mainly to present  a few documents of poetry, images , and other art/ music related stuff that I didn't feel to share as much in social platforms or with people I know.
Another thing about the files is that you can access it so feel free to view them ðŸ’•
