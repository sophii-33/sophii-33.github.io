### Welcome to My Sets of Work :laughing: !
 

Hii :D ! My name is Sophie Averilla and this website is mainly to present  a few documents of poetry, images , and other art/ music related stuff that I didn't feel to share as much in social platforms.
Another thing about the files is that you can access it so feel free to view them ðŸ’•

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sophii-33/sophii-33.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
